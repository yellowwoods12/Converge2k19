What we need to do is to create a single page containing 5 sections(Home, Events, Highlights, Reach Us, Meet our Team) - each section covering height of display screen.
A menu button should be fixed at top right corner of screen(as in "menu_button.html" file) for the whole page.
As we scroll down(or using a button) the transition effect(while moving from one section to the other) should be same as in the "page_transition.html" file.
For Going back to the above(previous) section, up arrow (bottom right) should be used -or- Scrolling Up can also be opted.
